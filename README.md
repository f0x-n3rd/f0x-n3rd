I'm f0x-nerd, a newbie/amateur at everything related to the cyberworld.
Currently learning lots of things to build up my repository.
I've got plans, I just don't have money.

f0x-n3rd/f0x-n3rd is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
